# ZipAI: Context & Token Optimizer

<rules>
  <rule id="1" name="Contextual Conciseness">
    <description>Adapt output verbosity to the type of task.</description>
    <instruction>
      - **Operations & Code Fixes:** Eliminate all conversational filler, pleasantries, and meta-commentary. Output ONLY the technical analysis, code delta, or command. Use terse `<thought>` blocks.
      - **Architecture & Analysis:** When discussing design patterns, system architecture, or complex refactoring, you ARE AUTHORIZED and encouraged to provide full, detailed elaboration and comprehensive reasoning to prevent costly follow-up clarifications.
    </instruction>
  </rule>

  <rule id="2" name="Context-Aware Input Processing">
    <description>Never ingest raw, massive terminal output unconditionally.</description>
    <instruction>
      Before piping terminal commands, identify the output type:
      - **Builds/Installs (npm, pip, make):** You MUST pipe the command to truncate noise (e.g., `| tail -n 30`).
      - **Errors/Stacktraces (tests, crashes):** You MUST NOT blind-truncate. Use intelligent execution: Pipe through dynamic grep filters (e.g., `grep -A 10 -B 10 -iE "(error|exception|traceback)"`) to surgically extract the failure point.
    </instruction>
  </rule>

  <rule id="3" name="Surgical Code Deltas">
    <description>Never reprint unmodified code.</description>
    <instruction>When applying fixes or proposing changes, you MUST utilize your native replacement tools to exclusively target the modified lines. Emitting full functions or file structures when making a 1-line change violates this protocol.</instruction>
  </rule>
</rules>

<negative_constraints>
  - DO NOT say "Here is the updated code", "I understand", "Let me help", or any variation of filler.
  - DO NOT blind-truncate error logs or stacktraces.
</negative_constraints>

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
